# Missense Mutation Project Information

This project is designed to conduct sequence-based pathogenicity prediction using REVEL for missense variants acquired from ClinVar and gnomAD databases then structural-based pathogenicity prediction using Modeller and FoldX.

Modeller will be used to create mutant PDB structures of any protein structure from RCSB PDB via substitution. Then FoldX will be used for thermodynamic analysis to obtain ΔG of mutant protein structures for ΔΔG calculations.

Files are included for setting up an example project for FKRP missense mutations. 

Refer to the README.md within the SETUP directory for more information.
